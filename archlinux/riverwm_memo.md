# Clone and Build

Follow the guide:

https://github.com/riverwm/river#building

(Maybe `polkit` is also required to handle seat.)

And other media control packages are also required, such as `pamixer` and `brightnessctl`.

# Exec

```
$ ~/.local/bin/river
```

# init file

Copy the default init file from `example/init`.
